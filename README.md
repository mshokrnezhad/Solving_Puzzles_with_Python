This approach, known as trial division, is one of the fundamental methods for prime number testing.
- **Interesting optimization techniques used:**
  1. Maintaining a list of known prime numbers and only checking divisibility against these, rather than all numbers up to the candidate.
  2. Starting the search from 3 and incrementing by 2 each time, effectively skipping all even numbers after 2, which are known to be non-prime.
  3. Using an early exit strategy in the primality test function (`IsPrime`), which stops checking as soon as a divisor is found.

### [Puzzle 008: Largest Product in a Series](puzzle_008)

- **Source:** [Project Euler's Problem 8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)
- **Puzzle Definition:**  
  The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832. Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?
- **Key lesson or insight gained:**  
  This puzzle demonstrates the importance of efficient string manipulation and numeric processing in handling large datasets. It emphasizes how a seemingly complex puzzle can be solved with a straightforward sliding window approach, highlighting the value of breaking down a large puzzle into smaller, manageable steps.
- **New concept or algorithm learned:**  
  The solution implements a sliding window technique to process the large number string. This approach involves moving a fixed-size window (in this case, 13 digits) across the string, calculating the product of digits within each window. This method is efficient for processing sequential data where you need to consider a fixed number of adjacent elements at a time.
- **Interesting optimization techniques used:**
  1. Converting the entire number to a string for easy digit-by-digit access, avoiding the need for complex numeric operations to extract individual digits.
  2. Using a single loop to iterate through the string, with a nested loop for the fixed-size window, which keeps the time complexity at `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the number string.
  3. Calculating the product incrementally within each window, rather than storing all possible 13-digit sequences and then calculating their products separately.
  4. Using an in-place comparison to update the maximum product, avoiding the need for additional data structures to store intermediate results.

### [Puzzle 009: Special Pythagorean Triplet](puzzle_009)

- **Source:** [Project Euler's Problem 9](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)
- **Puzzle Definition:**  
  A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which a² + b² = c². For example, 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5². There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc.
- **Key lesson or insight gained:**  
  This puzzle underscores the importance of understanding mathematical relationships and constraints to optimize search spaces. It demonstrates how leveraging puzzle-specific knowledge (in this case, properties of Pythagorean triplets and the sum constraint) can significantly reduce the computational complexity of finding a solution.
- **New concept or algorithm learned:**  
  The solution employs a targeted search approach for Pythagorean triplets. Instead of blindly checking all possible combinations, it uses the constraints of the puzzle to narrow down the search range:
  1. Recognizing that $a < b < c$ and $a + b + c = 1000$.
  2. Deducing that a cannot exceed 332 (`ceil(1000/3) - 1`).
  3. Calculating an upper bound for `b` based on the remaining sum after choosing `a`.
- **Interesting optimization techniques used:**
  1. Setting an upper bound for `a` at 332, which significantly reduces the outer loop iterations.
  2. Dynamically calculating the upper bound for `b` in each iteration of the outer loop, further optimizing the search space.
  3. Using integer division and modulo operations to handle both even and odd cases for the `b_bound` calculation.
  4. Implicitly calculating `c` from the sum constraint rather than using a third loop, reducing the overall complexity.

  This puzzle demonstrates the importance of efficient grid traversal and handling edge cases in 2D array operations. It showcases how a seemingly complex puzzle can be solved with a systematic approach, checking all possible directions in a single pass through the grid.
- **New concept or algorithm learned:**  
  The solution implements a sliding window technique adapted for a 2D grid:
  1. It uses nested loops to iterate through each cell in the grid.
  2. For each cell, it calculates products in four directions: right, down, diagonal right, and diagonal left.
  3. It handles edge cases by setting products to 0 when calculations would go out of bounds.
- **Interesting optimization techniques used:**
  1. Using numpy for efficient array operations and memory management.
  2. Reading the grid from a file, allowing for easy modification of the input without changing the code.
  3. Calculating all four directional products in a single pass through the grid, reducing time complexity.
  4. Using conditional assignments to update the maximum product, avoiding repetitive if-else statements.
  5. Leveraging Python's ternary operator for concise max value updates (e.g., `maxProd = right if right > maxProd else maxProd`).

### [Puzzle 012: Highly Divisible Triangular Number](puzzle_012)

### [Puzzle 013: You Will All Conform](puzzle_013)

- **Source:** [Puzzle 1 of Programming for the Puzzled](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-s095-programming-for-the-puzzled-january-iap-2018/pages/puzzle-1-you-will-all-conform/)
- **Puzzle Definition:**  
  You Will All Conform involves a vector of F's and B's, representing forwards and backwards caps. The goal is to find the fewest commands needed to get either all F's or all B's, by flipping caps in specified intervals.
- **Key lesson or insight gained:**  
  This puzzle demonstrates the importance of identifying intervals of similar items in a sequence and making optimal decisions about which intervals to modify. It shows how proper grouping can lead to efficient solutions for sequence transformation problems.
- **New concept or algorithm learned:**  
  The solution introduces two approaches: a two-pass interval-based method and a one-pass method. Both approaches identify consecutive sections of similar items but handle them differently.

  The interval-based approach collects all intervals first, then decides which type to flip, while the one-pass approach makes decisions on-the-fly.

  Since the groups of forward and backward caps must alternate in the sequence, the number of groups for each type will either be equal or differ by one. So, if we observe the first cap in the queue and decide to flip all groups of the opposite type, we ensure that all caps become uniform with the fewest possible commands (what we do in the one-pass method).

- **Interesting optimization techniques used:**
  1. Using intervals to group consecutive items of the same type, reducing the number of operations.
  2. Appending a sentinel value ('END' or first element) to handle the last interval without special case code.
  3. The one-pass algorithm that avoids storing all intervals, making it more memory-efficient.
  4. Leveraging the alternating nature of cap groups to minimize commands - since forward and backward groups must alternate, flipping all groups of one type ensures uniformity with minimal operations.
